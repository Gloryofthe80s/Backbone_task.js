Backbone_task.js
================

Task.js is a simple, lightweight task manager app built with Backbone. It uses Parse as the backend. 

User login has not been implemented, so all saved tasks are shared between anyone using the app. 

Deletion and completion of tasks is not yet implemented either (these were completed in the original task.js, but I haven't gotten around to implementing them in this Backbone version as of yet).
